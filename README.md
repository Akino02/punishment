# Punishment (Terminal)

This script tracks the number of deaths in your game.
Each death is punished by 10 push-ups (you can change the punishment in the script).
You can also track your friends deaths and remove completed punishments (by adjusting the death count).

In the future, this might become a Tkinter app.

## Updates
### Update-001
- You and your friends can track your death counts.
- Local storage: everything is saved in a JSON file.
